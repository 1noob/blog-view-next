<small>Favorite diaper bag</small>

## Tom Bihn Synapse 19

19 liters has been the sweet spot for our diaper bag for us. The Tom Bihn zippers are some of the best, easily open and close parts of the bag with one hand which is really important when changing diapers. The X-Pac makes it easy to wipe clean after the bag gets messy from bottles and such.
