Skip links allow keyboard users to easily move into the content of the page without having to repeatedly tab through each navigation link.

My `<Page>` component houses the main layout for all pages across this site. It includes the primary navigation and wraps the children in a `<main>` element.

The skip link should be the very first element on the page preceding your primary navigation, and by default is hidden in some fashion.

To do this with Tailwind, I fix position the link to the top left corner of the page and translate it -100% on the Y axis hiding it overscreen. When focused, I remove the transform which slides it into view.

Here is a simplified version of the setup below.

```jsx
<a
  href="#content"
  className="fixed top-0 left-0 transform -translate-y-full focus:translate-y-0"
>
  Skip to content
</a>

<nav>...</nav>

<main id="content">...</main>
```
