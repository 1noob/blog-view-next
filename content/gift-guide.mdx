## [Timex GMT watch](https://timex.com/products/q-timex-gmt-38mm-stainless-steel-bracelet-watch-tw2v38000)

I am a fan of my Apple Watch and wear that most of the time, but every now and then its nice to throw on a nice looking watch when going out. For those occasions, the Timex GMT has been my favorite, an everyday affordable GMT.

## [Benchmade Mini Bugout pocket knife](https://www.benchmade.com/products/533?)

This is likely the pocket knife I am throwing in my pants daily and one of the knifes I recommend for most people looking for a simple, lightweight, quality, everyday carry pocket knife.
