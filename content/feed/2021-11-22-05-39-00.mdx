Testing out the [Aer Slim Pouch](https://www.aersf.com/slim-pouch-xpac-black). I've been using the [Peak Design Tech Pouch](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/tech-pouch) for some time now, but I have found it to be to bulky for my needs.

So far, I am loving the X-Pac material and the hi-vis orange interior. Only initial criticism is that the zipper pulls are a bit long. Feels unnecessarily long. Other than that, feels like the perfect size for my needs.
