That combination makes him an excellent front-end engineer. We worked together on a new feature with a complex UI and he was able to interpret the designs with a care and detail that is rare, while also making thoughtful UX suggestions. Not to mention Alex is just a great person, easy to talk to and lovely to work with.”</p><p>– Amy Stuart, Senior Designer, NationBuilder</p>",

      "<p class='text-gray-800'>“Alex and I worked together during the first two years of my web development career. I count myself very fortunate to call him a friend, and to have learned so much from him over the years. He is incredibly skilled, efficient, and thorough in his work. Perhaps more than any other co-worker I have had, Alex possesses a deep and wide understanding of modern web technologies, while his steady passion for producing best-of-class work inspires his peers to write cleaner, simpler, and more elegant code. Alex would make a tremendous addition to any web development team wise enough to welcome him.”</p><p>– Kyle Luck, Developer, Mighty</p>",
